// 3.Write a Java program that uses StringBuffer to construct a simple text editor which can perform the following operations:
//a.Append a given string to the existing text.
//b.Insert a given string at a specified index within the existing text.
//c.Delete a portion of text between two specified indices.
//d.Reverse the entire text.
//e.Replace a portion of the text between two specified indices with a given string.
//Your program should display a menu with options to perform each of the above operations. 
//After each operation, print the current state of the text. Also, display the current 
//capacity and length of the StringBuffer after each operation to showcase its dynamic nature
