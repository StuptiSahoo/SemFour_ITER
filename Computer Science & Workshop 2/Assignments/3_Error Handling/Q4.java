//Implement a Java program that reads a file path from the command line argument and attempts to read the contents of the file. If the file path is null or points to a non-existent file, throw a custom FileNotFoundException. If the file exists but cannot be read due to permission issues, throw a custom FileReadPermissionException. Your task is to create these custom exception classes and handle them appropriately in your program.
